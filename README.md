### SuperSolarPanels. Remastered

Our mod is about new ways of generating energy. Not that new, but very progressive and often expensive.

Photonic, Singular, Spectral - all this is about SSP. Do you think that a photon cannot be compressed into an ingot? We
will prove the opposite!

In addition to Night, Day, Nether, End, Rain and etc. Panels. The mod adds improved quantum armor, new ores and many other items.

Based on ASP and other addons for IC2, we have a very voluminous mod, where everyone will find a goal for themselves.

Please, don't mistake out mod with **Legacy ver. which Depends on ASP**. Remastered is independent and most often **incompatible with ASP**

Among other things, the mod adds modules for panels that can increase the energy level, generation, internal storage,
change the type of panel or output RF energy

We are looking for translators and proofreaders If you are confident in your knowledge of the language and are ready to translate the mod, DM *spinel#2440* in Discord!
