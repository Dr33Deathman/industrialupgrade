### Industrial Upgrade

Industrial Upgrade is a global add-on with different and interesting things that diversify not only IC2 itself, but also your survival.
There was little accent on the panel (15 main and 11 additional). Each panel has its own level of pollution, dependence on the phases of the sun and moon, and has many modules for pumping!
Added 9 rotors and 10 different fuel rods so that the player can develop not only in the solar energy branch, but also in wind and nuclear energy.
The mod adds 46 new types of ores (90 ores in total).
Added 6 sets of armour, 5 different helmets, 20 tools and 6 types of backpacks. You can also paint them!
The main aspect of the mod is the mechanisms, about 144 mechanisms have been added!
The modular system in fashion is very extensive, it concerns not only panels, but also energy storage, mechanisms and the improvement of armour and tools in fashion! 


The mod not only extends its uniqueness to the main mod, but adds integrations to different mods, the list may differ in different MC versions!
